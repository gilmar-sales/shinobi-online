##The Forgotten Server

####Version: 0.3.6 (Crying Damson)

A server developed by Elf, slawkens, Talaturen, KaczooH, Lithium, Kiper and Kornholijo.

This is the fifth and last official release of the Crying Damson servers by the TFS developers, known for being really stable. 
Used it for years, never had any problems with it besides /reload creaturescripts, which doesn't work properly, so just restart the server if you make changes there.
